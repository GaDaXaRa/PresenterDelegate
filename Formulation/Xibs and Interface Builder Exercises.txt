##Exercise 1.
Add a button to the view controller interface. Make it have some particular characteristics:
    For the default mode, make it so it has a 17 point font, black text color and green shadow
        For the highlighted mode, we inverse the colors and the text turn green while the shadow turns black.

##Exercise 2 
Add an action to the button on Interface Builder so an alert view is shown when the button is pressed.

##Exercise 3. 
Create two more buttons that when pressed show the IHSecondViewController and IHThirdViewController respectively. What's the difference between loading both of them?

##Exercise 4.
 Create a subview for the second and third view controller using the CustomView XIB. Load it using these two different methods 
    - A `NSBundle` method.
    - A `UINib` instance.

##Exercise 5
Change one of the button's title in code. You will need to create an outlet to it.

##Exercise 6
Create three labels and connect them to the code using only one outlet. Change their font color using a loop.

##Exercise 7
Create a custom button so that it sets its background color to red every time it is instantiated from a Nib file.

(Bonus)
Set a label background color to blue and its layer cornerRadius attribute to 5.0 using Interface Builder only.
