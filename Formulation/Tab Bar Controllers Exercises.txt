Exercise 1:
Create a Tab Bar Controller with two view controllers inside and present it from the root view controller of the window.

Exercise 2:
Add an image to the view controllers' tab bar items. Changes the window `tintColor` and see what happens to the icons

Exercise 3:
Add a button in one of the view controllers that adds and removes a third view controller on the tab bar controller. Let's call this button "Add Bubbles"

Exercise 4.
Let's add a text field to the previous view controller to add new beer bubble types. When we enter some text and press the button, the third view controller gets created and adds a badge to the tab bar item indicating that there is a new value in there to be looked at. Also dismiss the keyboard so the user can see the badge.

(Bonus) Don't allow to switch tabs while editing the text field. When the third view controller is shown, lets remove the badge from it.
