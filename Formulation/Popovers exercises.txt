#Exercise 1
Given the image of the beer, have an button of type `UIButtonInfoDark` that when pressed, shows the information of that beer in a popover. The information about the view should contain a label with the title and a text view with the description.

##Exercise 2 
Limit the popover arrow directions to up and down

##Exercise 3
When we are editing the text view we should avoid hiding the popover so we don't lose the information we are writing.

(If we want to stop editing the text view we will need a way to send it the `resignFirstResponder` message, like a "Done" button.

(Bonus) Store the edited information in the presenting view controller so every time we open the popover, what we previously typed is there.
