##Exercise 1

Create a view controller that contains a button. Create a navigation controller that will be the root view controller of the window. Add our created view controller as the root view controller of the navigation controller. 

When we press the button it should take us to a second view controller. 

##Exercise 2
In the second view controller, change the navigation bar to be yellow, have a title and a view at the right that is an edit button.

##Exercise 3
When we press the edit button, we will show a toolbar with two buttons: "add" "remove". The Edit button will have to change to "Done". When we press done, we will hide the toolbar.

##Exercise 3
Hide the navigation bar and show a button instead that will take us back to the first one.
