##Exercise 1
Create a view using `initWithFrame:` and add it as a subview of the current view. Give it a `backgroundColor` so it can be distinguished from the superview.

##Exercise 2
Create a second view and add it behind the first subview but in a way that can still be seen. Give it another color. 

Then insert another one between the two.

##Exercise 3
Set three different autoresizing masks to the subviews to see how they perform when rotating the device.

##Exercise 4
Using the image in the assets,create image views with different content modes to see how they differ from the others

##Exercise 5
Perform some simple animations animating the `frame`, `center`, `alpha`, `backgroundColor` of a view.

##Exercise 6
Make a view fade out using an animation and then make it fade back in a second after it totally disappeared.

##Exercise 7
Create two UISlider instances and use them to configure the `transform` property of a new new. Use the the `CGAffineTransformMakeScale` and `CGAffineTransformMakeRotation` respectively to apply the values of the sliders. (These two functions create a transform from the original one, not from the current one)

##Exercise 8
Add a subview to the view being transformed and watch it change with its parent view.    

(Bonus) Change the center, frame or bounds of a view and log the changes to the other ones using `NSLog` to see how they all change together.
