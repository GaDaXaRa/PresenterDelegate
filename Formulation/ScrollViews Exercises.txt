#Scroll View Exercises

##Exercise 1
Create and add a scroll view using Interface Builder.

##Exercise 2
Add a label to the scroll view at the (0,0) coordinates. Why can't we see it?

##Exercise 3
Add some padding so the navigation bar doesn't overlap any of the scroll view's content. Adjust the scroll indicators accordingly. 

(We can also set the UIViewController `automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets` to YES

##Exercise 5
Add a second label at a point larger than the scroll view frame. We need to set something else in order to be able to scroll to that label. What is it?

##Exercise 4
Scroll between two specific points in the scroll view, one animatedly and the other one without animation. We can use the two navigation bar items to trigger this behavio towr

##Exercise 5
Have two red bar button items in the tool for the `dragging` and `decelerating` properties of a scroll view. Then have a scrollview that we can interact with. When we do it, those labels turn to green as the properties they represent become `YES`. Use the methods in `UIScrollViewDelegate` to manage those buttons.

##Exercise 
Have a scroll view with an the image in xcassets so we can zoom on it. We will also have an slider that we can use to set an specific zoom level. If we zoom the scroll view manually, the slider needs to get updated with the current zoom level.

##Exercise 
Create a paginated scroll view that shows a gallery of beer photos. Remember that the `contentSize` of the scroll view must be a multiple of its size.

##Exercise 
 Bonus. Implement this but using only 3 views inside the scroll view.
