//    Add a label to the scroll view at the (0,0) coordinates. Why can't we see it?
    
//    Add some padding so the navigation bar doesn't overlap any of the scroll view's content. Adjust the scroll indicators accordingly.
    
//    Add a second label at a point larger than the scroll view frame to see how the scrolling indicators appear.
}


//Scroll between two specific points in the scroll view, one animatedly and the other one without animation. We can use the two navigation bar items to trigger this behaviour


//    Have three red bar button items in the tool for the `tracking`, `dragging` and `decelerating` properties of a scroll view. Then have a scrollview that we can interact with. When we do it, those labels turn to green as the properties they represent become `YES`.
